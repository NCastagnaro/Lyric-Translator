# Lyric-Translator

This application utilizes the Google translate API to translate from Spanish to English, or vice versa. Just paste your lyrics in the text box and with the help of HTML/CSS/JS, it will output the corresponding lyrics side by side, once you press the "Side by Side Translation" button. Make sure to toggle the language button to change to the desired language. If you wish to translate a new set of lyrics, just click the "Paste New Lyrics" button to revert back to the text empty text box. From there, you can follow the same process as before.
